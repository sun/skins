This is a collection of skins we use for testing during development of Skinr module. These will not be supported, and will likely change dramatically on a regular basis, so use them at your own risk.

Skinr is in the process of removing support for .info files and moving to a PHP plugin implementation.  Development is happening in Drupal 7 (HEAD).
