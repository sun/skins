The package includes code for 12, 16 and 24-column grid layouts using a slightly modified version http://960.gs by Nathan Smith. The underscores have been changed to dashes (underscores will cause Skinr to blow up), and the container classes have been modified to target .container-x .wrapper, which is what I was using in my theme. Yours might be different.

Enjoy :)
